## :card_index_dividers: About the Project

The project aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Robo-Advisors by comparing their performance to the S&P 500 across various market periods (2018-2019, 2020-2021, 2023-2024). The goal was to assess the impact of annual fees on returns and identify conditions under which Robo-Advisors excel or falter. This comprehensive evaluation sought to provide actionable recommendations for investors, aiding in better-informed investment decisions.
